# Problem #19 for Project Euler

=begin
We don't need any code:
It is 100 years from 1901 - 2000 each with 12 months.
So that is 1200 months.
We assume a uniform distrubtion of days whose that are the first of the month
So sunday has a 1/7th chance.
Thus, 1200/7 = 171 is how many Sundays fell on the first of the month
We get lucky with this assumption but I think this problem is kinda dumd anyway
=end

puts 1200/7
